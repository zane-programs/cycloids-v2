# Cycloid Simulations

## Introduction

Hello and welocome to my simulations of the brachistochrone and tautochrone curves!

If you're not interested in building and running this code yourself, you can instead [click here](https://cycloids.vercel.app/) to see a live demo.

Also, if you'd like to see the version history for this project, check out `CHANGELOG.md`; I tried to keep a fairly thorough log of any changes I made.

## Installation

In order to build the code in this repository, you'll need to [install Node.js](https://cycloids.vercel.app/)

Once you have that, you will need to clone this repository, navigate to it in your terminal, and run `npm install -D`. This commnd will install all dependencies and development dependencies.

## Develop

To start the development server, run `npm start` in your terminal. To view it in your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

To create a production build of this code, run `npm run build` in your terminal. You will then find the output in the `./public` directory.
